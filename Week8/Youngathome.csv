"Notes","1. Once a person either lives with a partner or has a child, they are considered to have formed their own family and are no longer counted as being part of their parentsâ€™ family even if they still live in the same household. Therefore such people are deemed to be not living with their parents here.
2. The term ""Parent"" could include grandparents, step-parents or foster parents.
3. Students living in halls of residence during term-time and living with their parents outside term-time are counted as not living with their parents here."
